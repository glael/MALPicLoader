# MALPicLoader
Because of removal of api, every page has to be loaded. (this is slow, but it's the only way (probably*))

To use: change userName and listType variables, run using python3
(you will probably have to install beautifulsoup4 (using pip)





* The mobile list displays pictures, so if I could figure out how to fetch that with python, this process would be a lot faster. (AKA I'm too lazy to figure out how to do user agents)
